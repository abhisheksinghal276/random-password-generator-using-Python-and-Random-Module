# Random-password-generator-using-Python-and-Random-Module
In this project, I have tried to implement the Random Module of the Python language to implement my DSA learnings.

# What is the Random Module in Python?
Python Random module is an in-built module of Python that is used to generate random numbers in Python. These are pseudo-random numbers means they are not truly random. This module can be used to perform random actions such as generating random numbers, printing random a value for a list or string, etc.
